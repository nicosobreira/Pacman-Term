/* What is a ghost?
 * It's an enemy that follows a *target* (more on that on `Target System`)
 * The have 4 different modes
 *	Chase - The ghost tries to catch the player
 *	Scatter - The ghosts goes to a specif target on the maze, ignoring the
 *player
 Frightened - The ghost tries to escape from the player and can be
 *eaten
 Eaten - The ghost returns to the spawn area All this modes have a
 *table (down) of duration between Chase and Scatter

/* Target System
 * This make the decision on where the ghost will move depending on the
 * target position
 * 1. The ghost will check 3 options: the last movement choice, 90ยบ
 * clockwise and 90ยบ counter clockwise. Never 180ยบ
 * 2. Then it will exclude any walls
 * 3. Then move to the shortest liner path (x_to_target^2 + y_to_target^2 =
 * next_move)
 * 4. If the options give the same value it will follow an order: UP, LEFT,
 * DOWN, RIGHT
 */
